# Health Benefits

## Reduce migraines?

Although this area is still fledgling, there is still a growing body of research into therapeutic benefits of flickering light. In one pilot study, researchers used pulsating light to reduce the symptoms of migraine headaches. Anderson (1989) identified a small cohort of patients, who had previously had unsatisfactory control of their pain with traditional pain medication.

The subjects were long-term patients who presented chronic symptoms. Pulsing light goggles were administered during the initial onset of a headache. The subjects were instructed to close their eyes in order to diffuse the light. Patients reported that the goggles helped 49 out of 50 migraines and that 36 migraines completely stopped. Researchers found that most patients operated the goggles in frequencies slightly higher than 13 Hz. Subjects reported that the higher the frequency range, the more rapid the release. Patients also reported that the goggles were found to be both calming and relaxing (Anderson, 1989). It was concluded that pulsating light could be a beneficial therapy for chronic migraine sufferers. Since the study was a pilot study, further research was encouraged.

## Enhance Academic Performance?

Photic stimulation (flickering light) has also been identified as a way to enhance academic performance. In one study out of Western Washington University, students who were seeking counseling were divided into two groups: a control group and a group that received photic stimulation. Each participant received pre-and post-psychometric testing and physiological stress tests. A device similar to the light goggles called Biolight was utilized. It was ascertained that the subjects who were able to receive alpha band frequencies had increased memory and performance. This was determined by pre and post results derived from IQ tests. The researchers identified the weaknesses in the sample cohort as relatively small, and predominantly female. It was surmised that photic stimulation had therapeutic components, but that the results could not be generalized to a large population (Budzynski et al., 1999).

## Relieve Premenstrual Symptoms?

In another study, EEG and photic stimulation was used as a treatment for premenstrual syndrome. The subjects receiving the flashing light device utilized it for 15 to 20 minutes per day. The patients receiving light stimulation found a significant reduction in their symptoms. It was concluded that it was effective treatment for PMS. Noton (1997) suggested that it is possible that the light stimulation increases cerebral blood flow that is associated with increased neuronal activity. Noton (1997) suggests that neuro-training using a flicking light may be another modality for those who do not respond well to traditional meditative practices because of lack of motivation or ADHD.
