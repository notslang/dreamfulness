## Disclaimer

People with a history of photosensitive epilepsy should not use the Dreamachine. It is a rare condition, however it is something that has potential for danger and alarm. Danger and risk should be always avoided. Watching video games and intense television can also exacerbate photosensitive epilepsy.
